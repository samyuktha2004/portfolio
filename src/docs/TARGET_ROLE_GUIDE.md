# 🎯 Finding Your Target Role (Fresher's Reality Check)

**Last Updated:** December 27, 2025  
**Status:** Your positioning is now updated to "Design Engineer | I design AND code"

---

## 🚨 Important Clarification

You asked me to **review your portfolio AS IF I were a Senior UX/UI Designer**, NOT that you're **applying for** Senior roles.

This distinction matters because:
- ❌ "Senior" roles require 5-7 years of professional experience
- ✅ As a fresh grad (Dec 2026), you should target **Junior/Entry-level** roles

I've updated your portfolio to reflect realistic fresher positioning.

## 🎯 Realistic Target Roles for Freshers

### **🏆 RECOMMENDED: Design Engineer / Creative Technologist**

**Why this is YOUR best fit:**
- ✅ Values BOTH design + code (your actual superpower)
- ✅ Doesn't require deep UX research experience
- ✅ Infosys win proves you can design AND build
- ✅ Leadership shows cross-functional collaboration
- ✅ Growing role at startups and design tool companies

**Job description example:**
- "Build high-quality UI components in React"
- "Collaborate with designers to implement design systems"
- "Prototype new features quickly"
- "Bridge design and engineering teams"

**Current match:** 80% 
- You have the skills
- Need 1-2 case studies showing design thinking
- Portfolio already proves technical + creative ability

**Companies that hire Design Engineers:**
- Startups (Razorpay, Zerodha, Cred)
- Design tool companies (Figma, Framer, Canva)
- Product companies with design-forward culture (Swiggy, Zomato)

**Updated positioning:** ✅ Already done
```
Title: "Design Engineer | UX Designer who codes"
Seeking: "Junior Design Engineer / Creative Technologist roles"
```

---

### **🎨 ALTERNATIVE 1: UI Designer (Visual Design Focus)**

**Why this could work:**
- ✅ Your visual design is strong (proven in portfolio)
- ✅ Awards show design excellence
- ✅ Coding skills are a bonus (rare for designers)
- ⚠️ Still needs 1-2 design case studies

**Job description example:**
- "Design beautiful interfaces for web and mobile"
- "Create design systems and component libraries"
- "Work closely with developers for pixel-perfect implementation"

**Current match:** 70%
- Strong visuals
- Need to show design process
- Less competitive than UX Designer roles

---

### **💻 ALTERNATIVE 2: Junior Frontend Developer**

**Why this could work:**
- ✅ React/TypeScript portfolio proves coding ability
- ✅ Design background makes you stand out
- ✅ Doesn't require UX case studies
- ⚠️ Competing with CS grads who have more coding projects

**Job description example:**
- "Build responsive web applications with React"
- "Implement designs from Figma/Sketch"
- "Write clean, maintainable code"

**Current match:** 75%
- Can code
- Might need more technical projects
- Design skills are differentiator

---

### **❌ NOT RECOMMENDED: UX Designer (Junior)**

**Why this is risky right now:**
- ❌ Requires 2-3 detailed case studies showing UX process
- ❌ Needs user research, testing, iteration documented
- ❌ You have ZERO evidence of this in current portfolio
- ❌ 95% of UX Designer roles will auto-reject without case studies

**What you'd need:**
- 3 case studies (60 hours of work)
- User research documentation
- Wireframes, prototypes, testing results
- Business impact metrics

**Current match:** 30%
- Interest is there
- Proof is missing
- Don't apply until you have case studies

---

### **❌ DEFINITELY NOT: Product Manager**

**Why this won't work:**
- ❌ Usually requires 2-3 years of work experience
- ❌ Needs business strategy, stakeholder management, roadmapping
- ❌ Fresh grads almost never get PM roles at product companies

---

## ✅ What I've Already Updated

### 1. Your Title (Everywhere)

### 3. Your Role Description (TLDR)
**Before:** "UX/UI Designer × Frontend Developer"  
**After:** "Design Engineer | I design AND code"

**Why:** Clear positioning, emphasizes hybrid strength
